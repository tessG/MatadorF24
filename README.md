# Matador ( Monopoly )

## Description:
This is a project implemented by students following an object oriented design document in the form of a class diagram and sequence diagrams covering the most central use-cases of the Monopoly game play.
The project is used to demonstrate principles of object oriented programming (as well as analysis and design), to first year students of a CS education.


### Levels and objectives
1. **Client class and Domain class** (```Main - BankAccount```)<br />
How one class will hold an instance of another class and use it's methods to get things done.
2. **Utility classes** (```TextUI, FileIO```)<br />
How we have classes that are not part of the domain, and should be coded as generic helper modules that can be reused on differenc projects
3. **Object analysis** (```Game, Player, Board, Field```)<br /> 
How analysing the functional requirements should uncover the most important entities, candidate classes  
4. **Composition** (```game.takeTurn()```)<br />
How the structure of classes are connected through collections (Game - Player - BankAccount), (Game - Board - Field)
5. **Abstraction** (```Field < Property < Plot```).<br />
How classes can share implementations (inheritance) or promise to implement certain behaviours (interface) to enable polymorphism.



### With each level, we include new iterations on previous leves (some more vigourusly than others):
* lesson 1: level 1
* lesson 2: level 2, 1
* lesson 3: level 3, 2, 1
* lesson 4: level 4, (3), 2, 1
* lesson 5: level 5, 4, (3), 2, 1
